# Webhook System Documentation

This document provides comprehensive documentation for our webhook system, detailing the event types, request body structure, and authentication mechanisms.




## Event Types

Our webhook system dispatches requests based on specific event names, categorized primarily into `delivery` and `location` events. Each event signifies a distinct state change or action within our system.

### Delivery Events

Delivery events provide updates on the lifecycle of a delivery, from assignment to completion or failure. The following is a comprehensive list of delivery event types:

- `delivery.assigned`: A delivery has been assigned.
- `delivery.pickup_enroute`: The delivery driver is enroute to the pickup location.
- `delivery.pickup_arrived`: The delivery driver has arrived at the pickup location.
- `delivery.pickup_complete`: The delivery driver has completed the pickup.
- `delivery.dropoff_enroute`: The delivery driver is enroute to the dropoff location.
- `delivery.dropoff_arrived`: The delivery driver has arrived at the dropoff location.
- `delivery.dropoff_complete`: The delivery driver has completed the dropoff.
- `delivery.return_in_progress`: The delivery is in the process of being returned.
- `delivery.returned`: The delivery has been successfully returned.
- `delivery.canceled`: The delivery has been canceled.
- `delivery.failed`: The delivery has failed.

### Location Events

Location events provide updates on the geographical status of a delivery or driver. The following is a comprehensive list of location event types:

- `location.pickup_enroute`: The driver is enroute to the pickup location.
- `location.assigned_driver`: A driver has been assigned to the delivery.
- `location.pickup_complete`: The driver has completed the pickup and is now enroute to the dropoff.
- `location.dropoff_enroute`: The driver is enroute to the dropoff location.
- `location.return_in_progress`: The driver is in the process of returning to the origin.




## Request Body Structure

All webhook requests are sent as `POST` requests with a JSON payload. The structure of the request body is consistent across all event types and contains detailed information pertinent to the event. Below is a breakdown of the fields included in the request body:
